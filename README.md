## Project Summary üìã
* Using all the skills learned over the past six modules, our group has been assigned to create & design a real-world front-end application 
* The app must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap and must be interactive, accepting, and responding to user input
* It must use two server-side APIs, be responsive, and use client-side storage to store persistent data 
* The app can't use alerts, confirms, or prompts, and must use modals instead 
* Finally, it must be deployed to GitHub Pages
-----
# Collaboration Workflow ü¶æ
* After deciding what we wanted to focus on, our group started wireframing
* We created a basic HTML skeleton with some CSS styling that we knew we wanted to use
* Browsing for suitable APIs, we found two: TMDB, and a secondary API that produced a random movie-related quote
* Tasks were assigned using Git Hub Projects and recorded as we went
* The team worked together throughout class working sessions, and in pairs throughout the week
-----
## Breakdown of Tasks üìù
* We used the Git Hub project collaboration demo from our final class of the year for our project, which was set up by Mohnish
* Dan built the original wireframe concept once the group confirmed the direction we wanted to proceed in
* Coding tasks were assigned by language proficiency and supported by each group member
* Brock wrote the majority of our JavaScript
* Mohnish wrote our HTML skeleton and assisted with both CSS and JavaScript
* Dan wrote the majority of our CSS and some HTML
* Saran worked through Tailwind styles and additional APIs
